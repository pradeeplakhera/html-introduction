        <h3>A funny story</h3>
    <p>Once I was riding my bike with my friend on the pillion seat and it was midnight. I was caught by the police
        because my friend was not wearing any helmet. So I disowned my friend and lied to police that I dont know him
        and I gave him the lift as a humane gesture. Becuase it was mid-night and there was no public transport
        available. I did all this escape the fine, which I successfully did. Unfortunately my friend had to pay the
        fine. </p>
